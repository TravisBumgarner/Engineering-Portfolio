    "description": "SHOPS Plus needed updates to the design of their Assessment to Action website. I worked with a designer to turn her design proposal into an updated website. As part of this project I began learning PHP and wrote a script to generate small parts of the website. Additionally, files across the website needed to be updated, so I wrote a python script to automate the process.\r\n(Note: The website is not under my control anymore and might be changed at some point in the future.)",
