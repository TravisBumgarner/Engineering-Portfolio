    "description": "Why buy a camera pan and tilt tool when you can build one yourself with laser cut parts, some motors, and an Arduino?\r\nThis project began on a breadboard where I created a user interface to control panning, tilting, direction, and number of photos. Three servos total controlled panning, tilting, and taking photos. Once I knew what had to be housed, I created the case and arm to mount the camera in SolidWorks. These parts were then laser cut and glued together.",
