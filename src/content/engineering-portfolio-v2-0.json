    "description": "My Engineering Portfolio V1.0 was a great opportunity to learn about the fundamentals of web development but was completely lacking in a content management system. When I first started this project I knew nothing about WordPress. I began by watching a course on Lynda.com to familiarize myself with the fundamentals, then I got started on customizing settings, installing plugins, creating templates for posts and pages, designing a child theme, and finally adding content.",
