    "description": "The Cambridge Hackspace was in need of a security system but we were tight on money. I decided to build one from scratch instead. \r\nThis project consisted of two parts. The first was a motion sensing security camera powered by the Raspberry Pi and Python. With multi-threading, it was able to capture photos and upload them at the same time to a remote server.\r\nThe second part of the project was a front end for logging who looked at photos and a way to filter through them.",
