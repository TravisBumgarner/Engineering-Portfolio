    "description": "\"IDIN empowers a diverse network of innovators to design, develop, and disseminate technologies to improve the lives of people living in poverty. Our work helps move promising technologies and approaches through an innovation pipeline to achieve sustainable social impact. \"\r\nEach year, IDIN hosts several summits throughout the world, known as IDDS. This year I was invited to attend IDDS for two weeks in Cali, Colombia with a focus on waste and waste pickers. The summit began with classes covering various aspects of the design process. Participants were then grouped up and worked to solve a problem related to the topic of waste. My group's focus was on 3D printing and soda bottle trash.\r\nOur prototype, titled the Barbusora is a low cost 3D printing filament extruder aimed to increase the value of plastic for waste pickers. It transforms collected plastic into a higher value plastic. Collected plastic is sold by waste pickers at a low cost ($500 Colombian pesos per kg), and some plastic types that could be used in 3D printing aren\u2019t collected because there is no current market. Plastic aimed for 3D printing is sold at a high price ($130,000 Colombian pesos per kg) and imported mainly from China. Barbusora transforms collected plastic into 3D printing filament that waste pickers could sell at a higher price, reducing the amount of plastic being imported and providing a new product for waste pickers to sell.",
