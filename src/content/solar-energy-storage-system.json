    "description": "One of the key issues facing solar is the ability to store energy. Once the sun goes down, solar farms stop producing energy. One proposed solution is phase change material which can act as a battery for solar energy.\r\nFor this project, I led 5 teammates in the yearlong process of planning, design, construction and implementation.\r\nFor my part, I focused on the system piping, CAD model and control system.",
