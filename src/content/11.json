    "description": "As an extension of my interest in photography, I started shooting film. The process of getting the negatives was quite easy but I had no space for a darkroom to make full sized prints. The commercial option was to buy a film scanner which was quite expensive. I opted to build my own instead.\r\n\r\nThe setup consists of a holder for the film constructed of K'Nex, a stepper motor that pulls the film along the holder, a servo to take a picture with the camera, a user interface to enter size and quantity of photos, and an Arduino to control it all. The film was back-lit by my monitor.",
