    "description": "Photography has been a passion of mine but I never knew how a camera worked. This project was an exploration in turning a collection of electrical components into a camera with a user interface. To take the project one step further, I wrote a script in Python to stitch the images together.\r\nI did a three part write up on my photography blog which you can check out in the links.",
